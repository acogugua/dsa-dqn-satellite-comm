# dsa-dqn-satellite-comm
Real‑time Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA) for satellite communication using Deep Q‑Networks (DQN). The agent learns from the environment to allocate spectrum to ground users under GEO–LEO coexistence, improving spectral efficiency and reducing SLA violations. Includes demo, MATLAB scripts, and performance plots.
